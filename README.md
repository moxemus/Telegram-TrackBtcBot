# TrackBtcBot

This is very simple Telegram bot made by native PHP and MySQL. This bot works without webhooks, so you can run it anywhere.
For example, I set up my CRON to run index.php with param "mailing" every hour and bot notify subscribers about current BTC rate in every 0 minute.
I used only Telegram official API to manage the bot and free crypto exchange API for getting BTC rate.

You can modify this project or make your own based on it.<br/>
To start this service you need to create your own Telegram bot token and api.nomics.com token.
